# Secured_Distributed_Shared_Memory
This project creates a shared memory region between 2 applications using the MSI protocol. The data transferred between these regions and the status of the pages in the shared memory region are updated using the TCP/IP protocol. This project provides more security by validating the data sent between the applications using hashing and page signature verification. Also, TCP/IP  attacks are demonstrated here as well.
